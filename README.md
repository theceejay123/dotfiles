# My Dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles I use on my Linux installation currently Manjaro KDE edition, using i3-gaps though)

Program configs you can find here:
* i3 (i3-gaps)
* i3status
* Xdefaults
* bashrc
* ranger
* ncmpcpp & mopidy (to use spotify with ncmpcpp. for more information on how to do this check out this guide https://wvarner.blogspot.com/2017/10/setting-up-mopidy-ncmpcpp-and-spotify.html)
* powerline
* neofetch

More to come as I get more comfortable with Linux!

Props to Luke Smith, my rice is influenced by his dotfiles due to it's naturalness and workflow.
